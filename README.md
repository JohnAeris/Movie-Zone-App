<h1> MovieZone </h1>

<h3>ABOUT</h3>

  and collected from the internet. Moreover, coil library was also utilized to load images from the internet. It is much more quickly since it has a 
  variety of optimizations, including memory, disk caching, bitmap reuse, and downspacing the image in memory, which makes it faster than other 
  image loading libraries. Jetpack compose was used to build the user interface of the application. It displays the list of movies with its genre, title,
  director, and other details. It was also created with light and dark theme.</p>
